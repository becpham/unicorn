# Unicorn: Your Startup Equity, Simplified

If you're working in a startup, you know the deal—it's fast-paced, high-pressure, and every day is a new challenge. But for all the stuff we have to figure out, managing your startup equity shouldn’t be one of them. 

I built **Unicorn** because too many startup employees (and founders) are flying blind when it comes to their ESOPs. It’s not your fault—equity can be a nightmare to wrap your head around, with legal docs and spreadsheets that don’t tell you what you really need to know.

**Unicorn** makes it easy to understand what you own, how much it’s worth, and what you can do with it.

## Why Unicorn Exists

After years of working with startups and talking to people in the trenches, I realized there's a major gap. Everyone’s talking about stock options, but most people don’t *really* know how to manage them. And frankly, most tools out there don’t make it any easier—they're designed for lawyers or finance teams, not the people actually working their tails off to make the company grow.

That's where **Unicorn** comes in.

We built this app to make ESOPs as simple and transparent as possible. You shouldn’t need a lawyer to figure out your equity. You need answers that help you make smart decisions, and that's exactly what Unicorn delivers.

## What Unicorn Does for You

- **Clear Dashboard**: Finally, a way to see all your equity data in one place, in plain English. Know exactly what you own and how it works.
- **Real-Time Valuation**: Track how your options’ value changes with your company’s valuation. It's like your personal equity ticker.
- **Exercise Scenarios**: See what happens if you exercise now vs. later. Get the full picture—exercise costs, potential gains, and tax implications.
- **Tax Breakdown**: Taxes can be a killer if you’re not prepared. Unicorn helps you plan ahead, so you’re not blindsided when it’s time to exercise.
- **Open Source**: You can tailor this tool to your specific needs or your company’s structure. Customize it, build on it, and make it your own.

## Who’s It For?

If you're a startup founder, operator, or employee with stock options, **Unicorn** is for you. It doesn’t matter if you’re at an early-stage startup or preparing for an IPO—this tool helps you get a handle on your equity and plan for the future.

## Why Open Source?

Because we believe in transparency—just like startups should be with their teams. By keeping it open source, we're giving you full control over the tool that helps you manage what could be your most valuable asset. And if you're the kind of person who likes to tweak and improve things (like most of us in startups), you’ll appreciate being able to customize it for your needs.

## Getting Started

It’s simple:

1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unicorn`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Run the App**: `npm start`

Now you’ve got a clear view of your options, literally.

## Contribute

We built Unicorn because we’ve been in the same shoes, and we know how valuable it can be to have a tool that really works. If you’ve got ideas to make it better, or want to help push it forward, jump in. Startups are all about building—and we can always use more builders.
